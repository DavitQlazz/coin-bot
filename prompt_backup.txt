Explain in comprehensive detail a high-performance 5-minute scalping trading strategy targeting over 70% profit success across multiple asset classes, including forex, indices, cryptocurrencies, and stocks.

Provide your explanation structured into nine numbered sections as follows:

1. **Strategy Overview**: Describe the strategy’s goals, core strengths, and adaptability to different market conditions and asset classes.

2. **Indicators Used**: List and explain all primary and supplementary technical indicators employed (such as EMAs, MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands, Stochastic Oscillator, ATR, volume-based indicators). Include recommended indicator settings and clarify each indicator's role within the strategy.

3. **Entry Rules**: Detail precise entry conditions for both long and short trades. Incorporate EMA crossovers with MACD confirmation, RSI reversal signals alongside Bollinger Band confirmation, momentum analysis across multiple timeframes, and volume confirmations. Emphasize the importance of confluence among indicators and consideration of market structure elements to strengthen trade signals.

4. **Exit Rules**: Explain exact stop-loss placement techniques using both technical support/resistance and volatility-based metrics. Describe take-profit methods including fixed reward-to-risk ratios, technical target levels, and indicator-based exit triggers. Include partial exit strategies, trailing stop methods (such as EMA-based trails, Chandelier stops, and Parabolic SAR), and time-based exits to manage trade duration.

5. **Risk and Money Management**: Outline position sizing protocols incorporating fixed percentage allocations adjusted for volatility. Define daily risk limits and trade frequency caps. Provide techniques for optimizing winning trade percentage via signal quality filtering, active trade management, and loss circuit breakers. Mention key risk-adjusted performance metrics (e.g., Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown) that should be monitored.

6. **Rationale and Adaptability**: Discuss the reasoning behind the selected indicators, the entry and exit criteria, and the overall risk management framework. Explain how the strategy can be customized and adapted for different asset classes such as forex pairs, stock indices, cryptocurrencies, and individual stocks.

7. **Implementation Guidelines**: Recommend ideal chart setups, pre-trade checklists, and methods for ongoing performance tracking and evaluation.

8. **Example Scenarios**: Provide at least three detailed example trades demonstrating strategy application across differing asset classes—for example, a EUR/USD long trade, an S&P 500 short trade, and a BTC/USD long trade. Each example should cover the market context, entry signals, and trade management including stops and profit taking.

9. **Conclusion**: Summarize the strategy’s advantages, emphasize the critical importance of discipline, recommend demo trading practice prior to live deployment, and underscore the necessity for continuous strategy evaluation and adjustment.

Throughout the explanation, present step-by-step processes, formulas, and calculations where relevant (for instance, for position sizing and stop placement). Highlight the critical role of indicator confluence and strict risk control in achieving consistent profitability. Include trailing stop methods explicitly to lock in profits and enable high-frequency trading capabilities.
