# Copy example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your settings
nano .env
```

Configure the following in `.env`:

```bash
EXCHANGE=binance              # Exchange name (binance, coinbase, kraken, etc.)
API_KEY=your_api_key_here     # Your exchange API key
API_SECRET=your_secret_here   # Your exchange API secret

TRADING_PAIR=BTC/USDT         # Trading pair
TIMEFRAME=1h                  # Candle timeframe (1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, 4h, 1d)
INITIAL_CAPITAL=1000          # Starting capital in quote currency

STOP_LOSS_PERCENT=2.0         # Stop loss percentage
TAKE_PROFIT_PERCENT=5.0       # Take profit percentage
POSITION_SIZE_PERCENT=95      # Percentage of capital per trade

PAPER_TRADING=true            # Set to 'false' for live trading
```

### 3. Usage

#### Market Monitor (No Trading)

Monitor market signals in real-time without executing trades:

```bash
python monitor.py
```

#### Backtesting

Test your strategy on historical data:

```bash
python backtest.py
```

This will:
- Fetch 30 days of historical data
- Run the strategy on past data
- Show detailed performance metrics
- Generate a performance chart

#### Paper Trading

Practice with paper trading (simulated trades):

```bash
# Ensure PAPER_TRADING=true in .env
python bot.py
```

#### Live Trading

**⚠️ RISK WARNING**: Only use live trading after thorough backtesting and paper trading!

```bash
# Set PAPER_TRADING=false in .env
python bot.py
```

#### Strategy Optimization

Find optimal parameters for your strategy:

```bash
python optimize.py
```

This tests various parameter combinations and shows the best performing settings.

## 📊 Strategy Details

The bot uses a multi-indicator approach:

### Entry Signals (BUY)
- RSI < 35 and recovering (oversold bounce)
- MACD bullish crossover
- EMA(9) > EMA(21) (golden cross)
- Price near lower Bollinger Band
- Requires 3+ conditions to trigger

### Exit Signals (SELL)
- RSI > 70 (overbought)
- MACD bearish crossover
- EMA death cross
- Stop-loss triggered (-2% default)
- Take-profit triggered (+5% default)
- Requires 2+ conditions to trigger

## 📈 Performance Metrics

The bot tracks:
- Total profit/loss
- Return on Investment (ROI)
- Win rate
- Average win/loss
- Profit factor
- Risk/reward ratio
- Trade history with timestamps

## 🔧 Customization

### Modify Strategy

Edit `bot.py` to customize the trading logic:

```python
def generate_signal(self, df):
    # Add your custom indicators and logic here
    pass
```

### Add New Indicators

The bot uses the `ta` library for technical analysis. Add more indicators:

```python
# In calculate_indicators() method
df['custom_indicator'] = ta.trend.SMAIndicator(df['close'], window=20).sma_indicator()
```

### Change Risk Parameters

Adjust in `.env` file:
- `STOP_LOSS_PERCENT`: Maximum loss per trade
- `TAKE_PROFIT_PERCENT`: Target profit per trade
- `POSITION_SIZE_PERCENT`: Capital allocation per trade

## 🛡️ Safety Features

2. **Stop Loss**: Automatic exit on excessive losses
3. **Take Profit**: Lock in gains at target levels
4. **Position Sizing**: Risk only a portion of capital
5. **Rate Limiting**: Respects exchange API limits
6. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of network issues
